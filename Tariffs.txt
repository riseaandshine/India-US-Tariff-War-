India's Export
Chemical & Pharma: The U.S. market accounts for approximately $9 billion of India's pharmaceutical exports. Despite potential tariffs of 25% or more, Indian drugmakers are expected to maintain competitiveness due to cost advantages and established market presence. 
Agriculture and Food Products: Exports such as marine products, rice, and fresh fruits may face significant challenges if additional tariffs are imposed, potentially disrupting trade in these commodities. 

Metal & Engineering Products: India has reduced tariffs on several items, including lowering duties on high-end motorcycles from 50% to 30% and on bourbon whiskey from 150% to 100%. Trump has already imposed 25% tariffs on aluminium and steel, impacting Indian exports.
Machinery, Transport & Electronics: During the discussions, U.S. President Donald Trump announced plans to increase military sales to India, including the eventual provision of F-35 stealth fighter jets. India imposes a 16.5% duty on imported electronics, including smartphones, while the U.S. currently allows these imports duty-free

India's Import
Textile, Paper and Other Products: The labour-intensive industries of textiles, leather and wood products face relatively lower risk, due to smaller tariff differentials or a limited share of U.S.-India trade.

Chemical & Pharma : India has a high Import of energy and pharmaceutical products and has further plans to increase this, reciprocal tariff in this sector can be a game changer.
Agriculture and Food Products: If the United States decides to impose reciprocal tariffs on a broader range of farm products, India's farm and food exports - where tariff differentials are the highest but trade volumes are low - would be among the hardest hit.
